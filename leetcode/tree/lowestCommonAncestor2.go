/* https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/
Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia:
“The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Given the following binary tree:  root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]

Example 1:

	Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
	Output: 3
	Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.

Example 2:

	Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
	Output: 5
	Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

Note:

	All of the nodes' values will be unique.
	p and q are different and both values will exist in the binary tree.
